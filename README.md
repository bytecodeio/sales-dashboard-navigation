Extension Framework app that passes all dashboard values to external Bootstrap-React components to the navbar using javascript events. It passes checkboxes values to a checkbox component and radio button values to a radio button component. The components outside of the iframe update ALL dashboards in the app at the same time.

This EF also has a separate navigation dropdown for external links and the ability to Open Link in New Tab on right-click.

Run yarn dev to run the app locally. Then yarn run build to build the app.
